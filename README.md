# A/B Testing Case Study

## Overview
This case study explores A/B testing for a hypothetical software company aiming to improve download and purchase rates for their software. The experiment focuses on changes to the homepage and their impact on key metrics.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebooks  
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas`  
  - `numpy`  
  - `statsmodels`

## Key Findings

### Homepage Experiment
- **Objective**: Evaluate the impact of changes to the homepage, specifically the location of information about the free trial period, on the following metrics:
  1. Number of downloads
  2. Number of purchases  

#### Results:
1. **Number of Downloads**:  
   - The changes led to a **significant increase** in the number of downloads during the testing period.  
2. **Number of Purchases**:  
   - The changes did **not lead to a significant difference** in the number of software purchases.

#### Test Success Criteria:
- The test was considered successful if either of the evaluation metrics (downloads or purchases) showed improvement.  
- Based on the significant increase in downloads, the test was considered a **success**, and the changes were recommended for implementation.

## Recommendations
1. **Homepage Update**:  
   - Implement the changes to the homepage to capitalize on the increased number of downloads.  
2. **Further Analysis**:  
   - Conduct further investigations to identify factors influencing **purchases**, as the homepage changes alone do not appear to drive revenue growth.

## Conclusion
While the A/B test demonstrated that relocating information about the free trial period on the homepage significantly improved downloads, there was no evidence to suggest an associated increase in purchases. Future experiments should focus on additional factors influencing purchase behavior to optimize revenue generation.

# A/B Testing
A case study for A/B testing

Overview
A case study for A/B Testing for a hypothetical software company trying to improve download and purchasing rates of their software
Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter notebooks
Libraries: pandas, numpy, statsmodels
Key Findings
Homepage Experiment
There was a significant difference in the number of downloads of the software as a result of changes to the homepage (location of information informing of the free trial period)
There was not a significant difference in the number of purchases of the software during the testing period
Criteria for a successful test was that either of the evaluation metrics were considered successful, so the test was considered a success, with a recommendation that the changes be implemented
The results suggest that this change in the homepage will not be associated with an increase in revenue and further examination of factors leading to increased purchases are recommended
